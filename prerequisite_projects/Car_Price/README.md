## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars and their prices. It includes features such as:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Engine Size
- Horsepower
- Transmission
- Fuel Type

## Installation
