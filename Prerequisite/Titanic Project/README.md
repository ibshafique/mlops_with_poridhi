## Variable Notes

### `pclass`: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
- **1st** = Upper  
- **2nd** = Middle  
- **3rd** = Lower  

### `age`
- Age is fractional if less than 1.  
- If the age is estimated, it is in the form of `xx.5`.

### `sibsp`: Family relations
- **Sibling** = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister  
- **Spouse** = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)  

### `parch`: Family relations
- **Parent** = mother, father  
- **Child** = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson  

> Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore `parch = 0` for them.
